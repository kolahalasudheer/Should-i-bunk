I want to build a full-stack web application called “Should I Bunk?”

🎯 Problem Statement:
Students often face a funny but real dilemma every day: “Should I attend today’s class or just bunk it?” This decision is influenced by various real-life factors like attendance %, mood, weather, upcoming tests, and peer pressure. But most apps don't let students make this decision with logic, fun, or context.

💡 Goal of the Project:
Create a web app that takes in user input, evaluates multiple personal + environmental factors through a smart rule-based scoring engine, and helps students decide whether to bunk a class or not — while making the process fun and intelligent using AI-powered excuses and explanations.

🚀 What the Project Will Do:

Accept student inputs:

Current attendance percentage

Mood level (e.g., tired, lazy, energetic)

Days until next exam

Professor strictness level

Weather (via API)

Day of the week

Compute a Bunk Score using a custom, rule-based logic engine with weighted inputs

Based on the score, provide one of three decisions:

✅ "Yes, Bunk it!"

⚠️ "Risky, Your Call"

❌ "Don’t Bunk Today"

Use Cohere API to generate:

A funny or serious excuse ("Had food poisoning from hostel samosa")

A smart explanation ("You’ve already missed 3 classes this week. Bunking again could drop your attendance below 75%.")

Integrate OpenWeatherMap API to factor in current weather

Show a decision dashboard with:

Bunk Score

Final Recommendation

AI-generated excuse and explanation

Maintain Bunk History and display analytics like:

Days bunked

Most common excuse

Weekdays when bunking is highest

Add Friend Voting: Let friends vote "Should you bunk today?" and show their responses

Bonus: Add an Anonymous Confession Wall for users to share funny bunk reasons

🛠️ Tech Stack:

Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS

Backend: FastAPI (Python)

Auth: Firebase Authentication

Database: MongoDB Atlas

AI: Cohere API (generate endpoint) for excuses and explanations

External API: OpenWeatherMap API (weather data)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Railway (Backend), MongoDB Atlas

📊 Bunk Score Calculation (Rule-Based):
A custom logic engine will compute a score (0–100) based on:

java
Copy
Edit
Bunk Score = (Attendance Score × 0.4) +
             (Exam Proximity Score × 0.2) +
             (Mood Score × 0.15) +
             (Weather Score × 0.15) +
             (Professor Strictness Score × 0.1)
Thresholds:

Score > 70 → Bunk

Score 50–70 → Risky

Score < 50 → Attend
